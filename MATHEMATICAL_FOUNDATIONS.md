### Contribution

The mathematical architecture underlying OCAM WR-039T was developed by Donald J. McConnell, whose rigorous work on deterministic verification systems provides the formal foundation for this framework.

### Key Mathematical Innovations

- **Walsh-Rademacher Transforms**: Explicit derivation from first principles using Rademacher functions
- **Multi-Field Discrete Algebra**: Integration of ℤ₃ field, ℤ₄ and ℤ₉ rings with formal homomorphism φ: ℤ₉ → ℤ₃
- **Hierarchical 52-Tier Architecture**: Three-phase processing with mandatory verification gates
- **Parseval Energy Conservation**: Sub-millisecond numerical consistency checks
- **Cryptographic Provenance**: SHA-256 Merkle chains for tamper-evident audit trails
